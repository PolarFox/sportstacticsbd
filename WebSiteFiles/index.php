      <h3>Software Development</h3>
      <p>If you've got experience 
      developing .NET Forms applications, and a basic interest in sports, 
      you are a candidate for helping. </p>
      
      <h3>Tactics Library Development</h3>
      <p>We will need the help of coaches, trainers and officials from various sports 
      to put together useful sets of tactics so that we can create a library to
      distribute with the product.</p>
      <p>It is important that the tactics come from your own experience, as they cannot
      be copied directly from books or other places due to copyright reasons. You 
      will also have to be willing to release your tactics libraries under the 
      GPLv2 license. You still retain copyright under that license.</p>
